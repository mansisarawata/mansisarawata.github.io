In this project I am exploring Single View Scene Generation through Individual Object Reconstruction. I delved into advanced techniques for 3D learning employing YOLOvS and SAM for object detection, CubeRCNN for 3D pose estimation, PixelNeRF, and Vision Transformer for single-image-to-NeRF predictions, and iNeRF for 3D object localization, this approach aimed at reconstructing detailed 3D scenes from a single image.

Utilizing Blender-generated scenes and the KITTI dataset, this project validates the methodology's adaptability across diverse scenarios. Beyond technical achievements, the project proposed this approach as an innovative data labeling technique, contributing to annotated datasets for machine learning model training.


In summary, this project showcased dedication to advancing 3D learning, pushing the boundaries of knowledge in computer vision, and contributing innovatively to the field.

In addition to the technical advancements, the project underscored the potential societal impact of our findings. The ability to generate detailed 3D scenes from a single image holds promise for various applications, ranging from virtual reality and augmented reality experiences to autonomous navigation systems. By presenting this approach as a viable data labeling technique, we aim to contribute not only to the academic understanding of 3D learning but also to the practical implementation of advanced computer vision solutions in real-world scenarios. Our commitment to innovation and relevance within the broader technological landscape solidifies this project as a noteworthy exploration at the intersection of cutting-edge research and practical applications.



<!-- Every project has a beautiful feature showcase page.
It's easy to include images in a flexible 3-column grid format.
Make your photos 1/3, 2/3, or full width.

To give your project a background in the portfolio page, just add the img tag to the front matter like so:

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/1.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/3.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/5.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/5.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.
</div>

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.


<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>


The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}
```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
```
{% endraw %} -->

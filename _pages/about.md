Hi There!!! If you are looking for one Mansi Sarawata; you are at the right page! :-P

I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering - Research with a focus on **Robotics** at CMU, where I am advised by <a href='https://theairlab.org/team/sebastian/'>Sebastian Scherer</a> at AirLab. My current research endeavors revolve around Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) for autonomous agents, as well as 3D reconstructions.

I graduated from the <a href='https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/'>Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur (IIT Kharagpur)</a> in 2022, attaining a Bachelor's (with Honors) in Mechanical Engineering. I successfully defended my bachelorâ€™s thesis on Fuzzy Logic-based PID controllers for quadrupeds, conducting research under <a href='https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/department/ME/faculty/me-dkpra'>Prof. D.K. Pratihar</a> at <a href='https://sites.google.com/site/softcomputinglaboratory/home'>Soft Computing Lab</a>.

As an aspiring professional, I am actively seeking full time opportunities starting May 2024 for Software/Research Engineering roles in SLAM, Perception, and 3D Vision. Feel free to explore my projects page and the exciting world of robotics.


My never-ending family, to which I am forever indebted, includes:
